hw assingment for week 4 crystal collector or rpg game
I did the crystal collector.  The game logic is working as far as I can tell. I failed in the display though.  I am not able to 
get the objects to align like in the sample.  Also struggled getting graphics, so I made my own from drawings using 
microsoft paint.  Also could not get background image from url to work.
